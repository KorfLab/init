Plase Don't
===========

+ Don't copy-paste code
+ Don't attach large files
+ Don't use pixel graphics
+ Don't take screenshots with your phone
+ Don't run a job without estimating resources
+ Don't justify poor practices with "just"
+ Don't suffer in silence

## Copy-Paste ##

If you want to improve your coding skills, write code. If you want to improve
your copy-paste skills, copy-paste. Every time you copy-paste code instead of
typing, brain cells die.

## Attachments ##

Please don't send large attachments in email or team messaging. If you must
send someone data files, always compress it first. The better way to share data
is to send a URL to a file or directory in the cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox,
Box, Mega, etc). A common source of large files is PowerPoint presentations
with pixel graphics.

## Pixel Graphics ##

Image formats like GIF, HEIC, JPG, PNG, and TIFF store graphics as pixels. They
don't scale well and can take up enormous amounts of storage. It's much better
to make graphics in vector format (e.g. SVG, Illustrator). PDF can be a mixture
of formats, so don't be fooled into thinking that PDF is all vector.

## Screenshots ##

Screenshots are rarely necessary. If you're working in a terminal and get an
error message, you can copy-paste the text of the error message (it's okay to
copy-paste error messages, but not code). Screenshots use a lot more storage.
If you take a picture with your phone, the file may be really large. Even
though computers today have lots of storage, it's always a good idea to be
mindful of how much space things take.

## Resources ##

There are 5 resources for every job.

+ CPUs
+ RAM
+ Storage
+ Network
+ Time

If you don't have an accurate estimate of how much each resource your job will
take, you don't have any buisness running the job. How do you estimate these?
Using `top` or `/usr/bin/time`.

## Just ##

When someone says "I'm not a racist, but..." you know the next thing out of
their mouth will expose their racism. Similarly, when a programmer says "I was
just...", you know they are about to make an excuse for some programming
transgressions like hard-coded paths. Laziness leads to poor programming
practices. Try to code the right way 99% of the time.

## Silence ##

Whether you can't figure out how to debug a random error or anxiety prevents
you from leaving the house, don't suffer alone. Ask for help. Your lab is part
of your family and wants to help you if you give them half a chance.
