Computer Setup
==============

We do science and write code in a Unix/Linux environment.

## Unix/Linux ##

Most professional bioinformatics is done in a Unix/Linux environment. While
Windows now has built-in support for Linux (WSL), it's generally better to work
inside a Linux virtual machine (VM). There are other Unix CLI environments like
Cygwin, and Gitbash for Windows. They generally work most of the time.

Mac users have Unix built in (Darwin), and typically don't use VMs. By default,
MacOS does not install the developer tools, so you'll have to do that manually
to have programs like `git` by doing: `xcode-select --install`.

All of the clusters on campus run Linux. At some point your computational needs
will exceed your personal computer and you will need to use a cluster, which
means a Unix-like CLI.

To install a local CLI environment, you can:

- Buy a Mac
- Install Linux on an older PC (e.g. a $100 used laptop)
- Install VirtualBox on PC and run some Linux distro (e.g. Lubuntu)
- Install Cygwin on PC
- Use the Linux environment in Windows

Modify your login script (see `init/etc/profile` for inspiration).

Use `top` or `htop` to monitor resources live. Prepend `/usr/bin/time -v` to
examine resources after a job is done. The normal `time` command doesn't do
this. You may have to install `/usr/bin/time` via conda.

If `git` asks for you personal access token again and again, use the following
command to make it persist: `git config --global credential.helper store`.

## Hive ##

To use the UCD cluster, get an account on Hive. Go to https://hippo.ucdavis.edu
and select the Hive cluster. Your sponsor is ikorfgrp.

Each user has a home directory with 20G. This is backed up. 20G is probably
enough for your needs, but if not, create a home-away-from-home in the shared
space `/quobyte/ikorfgrp/home`. To do that, you will need to redefine `$HOME`
to point to the new location. Note that nothing in `/quobyte/ikorfgrp` is
backed up.

If you are about to run a job on the cluster and don't know how much RAM and
disk space your job will use, you shouldn't run the job. Step away from the
keyboard until such time as you can be a responsible user.

How can you determine what resources will be required without running the job
in the first place? By doing experiments on a smaller scale and observing what
happens as the scale increases. To observe the resources used, prepend
`/usr/bin/time -v` to your job (which may not be installed by default).

For testing purposes, you may find `bin/mysbatch` useful for running mock slurm
jobs on the cluster. There is an example slurm file in
`data/sbatch-example.slurm`.

Once you are running jobs on the cluster, `squeue --me` is how you see the
status of your jobs (running, queued, etc). You can also view all the other
jobs on the cluster and even get the data in json.

## Conda ##

You should use Conda to install most CLI software both on your personal
computers and your Hive account.

To install Conda on your personal computer: https://conda-forge.org/miniforge

Conda is already provided on Hive via `module load conda`. You should probably
add this to your `.bash_profile`. Even though the `module` system has a lot of
bioinformatics software already installed, you should avoid using it if
possible. Why? Because the module system isn't easily replicated by you or
others on computers elsewhere. Recall Rule #2.

Here are the most common `conda` commands.

- `conda env list` shows environments available
- `conda info --envs` same as above
- `conda activate` starts the base environment
- `conda activate <name>` starts a named environment
- `conda deactivate` deactivates the current environment
- `conda info` lots of info about the current environment
- `conda list` list packages in the current environment
- `conda env create -f <file.yml>` create an enviroment from a YAML file
- `conda env remove -n <name>` remove a named environment
- `conda create -n <name>` create a new environment with nothing in it
- `conda install <name>` install a package in current environment
- `conda remove <name>` remove a package from the current environment

When creating or modifying environments, use a YAML file rather than installing
individual components.

In general, use generic names like `blast` rather than `blast ==2.16.0`.

To compare environments, `conda activate` each environment and then `diff` the
outputs of `conda list`.

## Personal Computers ##

You are expected to do some work on your personal computer(s) (see Rule #2).
Most operating systems have directories for Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.
Where should you put your code and experiments? All of my Git repositories are
inside a Code directory. Experiments with that code are generally in a `build`
directory, since that is ignored by Git.

```
Code/
	bin/
		benchmark@ -> ../init/bin/benchmark
	lib/
		korflab.py@ -> ../init/lib/korflab.py
	init/
		bin/
			benchmark
		lib/
			korflab.py
Desktop/
Documents/
Downloads/
```

- All repos are in the `Code` directory
- `$PATH` includes `Code/bin` and I softlink files to that directory
- `$PYTHONPATH` includes `Code/lib` and I softlink files to that directory
- Large datafiles are always kept compressed

## Style Guide ##

In general, we rabidly follow the style guides of the languages we write in.
These "rules" apply to all languages:

- Don't use language-specific constructs just because you can
- Follow the 80 column rule (lines should be less than 80 characters)
- Variables are nouns, functions are verbs
- The larger the scope of a variable, the longer the name
- The larger the scope of a function, the shorter the name
- Use tabs for left-side indentation unless the language says NO
- Never hard-code file or directory paths
- Avoid global variables
- Don't write function that have side-effects
- De-nest conditionals
- Avoid ISA inheritence or limit to 1 level
- Python specifics
	- We use tabs for indentation (if you must use spaces find another lab)
	- Use `argparse` for CLI
	- Use `if __name__ == '__main__'` only if you know why
	- Limit dunders and decorators
	- Annotations are cool, but documentation is cooler
- R specifics
	- Use tidyverse syntax only (tibbles not data.frames)
	- Use snake_case for variables and MixedCase for functions
- C specifics
	- Tabs and one true brace
	- Everything is a pointer to a struct
- Other Languages
	- C++: `std::count << "C is better" << std::endl;`
	- C#: `Console.WriteLine("MicroSoft Sucks");`
	- Go: `fmt.Println("Yes, please")`
	- Java: `system.out.println("hell.no.thank.you");`
	- Javascript: `console.log("no, not for bioinformatics");`
	- Julia: `print("it was swell but the swelling went down")`
	- Lua: `print("Really? Let's discuss!")`
	- Rust: `printlin!("Maybe. Let's discuss");`


Plase Don't
===========

Since we just covered some best practices, we might as well talk about some
worst practices.

- Don't copy-paste code
- Don't indent with spaces
- Don't run a job on a cluster without estimating resources
- Don't attach large files
- Don't use pixel graphics
- Don't take screenshots with your phone
- Don't justify poor practices with "just"
- Don't suffer in silence

## Don't copy-paste ##

If you want to improve your coding skills, write code. If you want to improve
your copy-paste skills, copy-paste. Every time you copy-paste code instead of
typing, brain cells die. You're here to learn, not be a copy-paste robot.

## Don't indent with spaces ##

I don't give a fuck if 4 space indent is preferred in Python, it's not
preferred in this lab. Indent with tabs. If you can't tell the difference
between the two lines below, please learn. If you are adamant about spaces for
indentation, join another lab.

```
while True
	# indented with a tab
    # indented with 4 spaces
```

When wrapping long lines, do not pad to the opening brace.

```
while this_function_is_reall_long_and_has_lots_of_arguments(foo, bar, cat, dog
                                                            cow, pig):
```

## Don't run a job on a cluster without estimating resources ##

There are 5 resources for every job.

- CPUs
- RAM
- Storage
- Network
- Time

If you're about to run a large job on a cluster and don't have an accurate
estimate of how much each resource your job will take, you don't have any
buisness running the job. How do you estimate these? Using `top` or
`/usr/bin/time` with dev data (see Rule #1).

## Don't attach large files ##

Please don't send large attachments in email or team messaging. If you must
send someone data files, always compress it first. The better way to share data
is to send a URL to a file or directory in the cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox,
Box, Mega, etc).

## Don't use pixel graphics ##

Image formats like GIF, HEIC, JPG, PNG, and TIFF store graphics as pixels. They
don't scale well and can take up enormous amounts of storage. It's much better
to make graphics in vector format (e.g. SVG, Illustrator). PDF can be a mixture
of formats, so don't be fooled into thinking that PDF is all vector.

## Don't take screenshots with your phone ##

Screenshots are rarely necessary. If you're working in a terminal and get an
error message, you can copy-paste the text of the error message (it's okay to
copy-paste error messages, but not code). Screenshots use a lot more storage.
If you take a picture with your phone, the file may be really large. A student
once sent me a 14M image of an error message that was 14 characters long.
That's a 1 million-fold increase in size. Even though computers today have lots
of storage, it's always a good idea to be mindful of how much space things
take.

## Don't justify poor practices with "just" ##

When someone says "I'm not a racist, but..." you know the next thing out of
their mouth will expose their racism. Similarly, when a programmer says "I was
just...", you know they are about to make an excuse for some programming
transgressions like hard-coded paths. Laziness leads to poor programming
practices. Try to code the right way 99% of the time.

## Don't suffer in silence ##

Whether you can't figure out how to debug a random error or anxiety prevents
you from leaving the house, don't suffer alone. Ask for help. Your lab is part
of your family and wants to help you if you give them half a chance.
