Work-Life Balance

Thoughts on the problems of being a professional scientist.

Fast, Cheap, Reliable
---------------------

There is a saying when it comes to race cars: "fast, cheap, reliable: pick
two". There is a recognition that you can't have everything.

In Science, we don't say that. The sentiment is more like "intelligent,
creative, self-motivated, hard-working, independent, collaborative,
disciplined, flexible, reliable, accountable, personable: choose (all) eleven".

+ Intelligent - you can solve the problems that are in front of you
+ Creative - you can find new problems to solve
+ Self-motivated - nobody has to tell you to show up for work
+ Hard-working - you work many hours
+ Independent - you don't need others to succeed
+ Collaborative - you recognize success requires others, and welcome them
+ Disciplined - you can behave precisely as required
+ Flexible - you make room for difficulties
+ Reliable - people can count on you to show up or deliver on time
+ Accountable - you take credit for your failures
+ Personable - you are likable as a person and co-worker

It's unfair to be expected to be good at everything, and yet many scientists
beat themselves up because they aren't. Give yourself the breathing room you
would give to others. You don't have to be an A+ or even A- in all of these.
But try not to have an F in any of them.


Work Ethic
----------

How hard does one _need_ to work? Partly, that depends on your future plans.

Back when I was in graduate school, everyone had the same goal: become a
professor. That's a little unrealistic. There aren't that many jobs for
professors. All the professors you know right now worked really hard as
graduate students, and even harder as post-docs. It wasn't possible to become a
professor unless you were working evenings and weekends. Is that still true
today? Probably. Is it unhealthy for future professors to work 60 hours per
week? Probably. Is this a form of academic hazing? Probably. Ultimately, if you
have designs on becoming a professor, you might need to work 60 hours per week
because the competition is doing that. On the plus side, being a professor is a
pretty great job most of the time and I have a hard time imagining myself doing
something else.

What if you want to be a staff scientist job in an industry setting? If the
company is well-established, you might end up in a 40 hour work week with HR
telling you not to work more. However, in a start-up you might be working
harder than you would trying to become a professor.

My dream is that my students work more than 40 hours per week because they
can't help it. They just love research that much. It is a dream...


Researcher Effectiveness Rating
-------------------------------

Your RER is a measure of how well you are playing the Bioinformatics Researcher
Game in the Korf Lab. If you want a high RER, you should do the following:

+ Be more proactive than reactive or non-active
+ Be interactive and collaborative with other members of the lab
+ Follow best practices in your computer environment
