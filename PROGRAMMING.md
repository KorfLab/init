Bioinformatics Development Environment
======================================

Our typical development environment uses the following technologies:

+ Host OS (Windows or Mac desktop or laptop)
+ Linux Virtual Machine (e.g. VirtualBox running Lubuntu)
+ Conda (for software management)

![Overview](layout.png)


Linux Virtual Machine on Windows
--------------------------------

Most professional bioinformatics is done in a Unix/Linux environment. While
Windows now has built-in support for Linux, it's better to work inside a Linux
virtual machine (VM). Why?

+ Your products will be more portable
+ You can protect your host OS from running out of memory
+ You can protect your host filesystem from running out of storage
+ You can't destroy your host computer from stupid things you might do
+ You can avoid overly protective host OS securities

What are the downsides of running a VM?

+ You have to install VirtualBox or some other software
+ You have to split RAM between your host and VM
+ Programs running inside the VM may run a tiny bit slower

The downsides are trivial problems. When you're developing software and
pipelines, you don't need much RAM or space. If you find that's not true, you
need to go back and review Rule #1.


Mac Notes
---------

Newer Macs with M1/M2 etc. chips use ARM architecture and are not compatible
with the x86 Linux world. Therefore, they don't (yet?) work with the usual
virtual machines and Conda binaries. If you're on an ARM Mac, your life will be
a little more difficult because of that.

If you're on an x86 Mac, you can use VMs, but you might not have enough RAM due
to some bugs/features of VirtualBox. If you work in the native OS, and not a
conda environment, you may find that many packages aren't available.


Darwin, WSL, Cygwin, RPi, etc
-----------------------------

Programming in multiple environments will make your code more robust. Once you
get everything set up in a Linux VM, go ahead and also program in other
operating systems. The built-in support for Darwin (the name of Unix on Mac)
and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is pretty attractive. There are other
Unix-like environments that are also useful like Cygwin and Gitbash. You may
find it fun to program on a Raspberry Pi or in Haiku. Just don't make any of
these alternative environments your _only_ environment.


Conda
-----

Within the VM, we manage our software with Conda. Does it sound wasteful that
the host OS has Python, the VM has Python, and yet we override both of those
and run Python from Conda? Yes, it is wasteful. However, it's also something we
control ourselves. The host OS might update its resources and break our code.
The VM may update and break our code. Conda allows us to control all of our
software dependencies.

You don't need root/superuser access to install software with Conda. This saves
both your time and the sysadmin's time. The extra storage space used is a small
price to pay for reproducibility and time savings.


VM Installation
---------------

Q: Which Linux distribution should I use?

A: It doesn't really matter. The Linux distributions designed for older
hardware use less resources. Lubuntu and Linux Lite are two excellent choices.

These instructions assume you will be installing a Lubuntu Linux distribution
on a Windows computer using VirtualBox. It's not very different with other
distributions or MacOS.

Stuff you will need:

+ Lubuntu https://lubuntu.me
+ VirtualBox https://www.virtualbox.org

Actions you will take:

1. Download Files
2. Create Virtual Machine
3. Install Lubuntu
4. Install Anaconda
5. Post-install Tweaks

### Troubleshooting

If you follow the instructions below and you get stuck, ask for help.

Some Windows computers are not set up for virtualization. You may need to
change some BIOS settings.

MacOS may require changing some security settings.

### 1. Download files

Download the latest Lubuntu or equivalent distribution. The file will be named
something like "lubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso". It's about 2GB.

Download VirtualBox. It's much smaller. Run the installer.

### 2. Create Virtual Machine

Click the "New" button to create a new VM. You can name it anything. I used
Lubuntu-21.10 because that's what I downloaded. Choose a location. Sometimes I
use the default, but sometimes I choose an external drive. The type is Linux and
the Version is Ubuntu (64-bit).

Assign the VM 2G Memory. The install might not work well with less and doesn't
need any more. You can change the amount of memory and the number of CPUs
later.

Create a virtual hard disk using the default VDI and dynamic allocation. Set
the size to 40G. Because of the dynamic allocation, you will only use about 10G
in Windows. For software development and testing purposes, you will probably
not need more than 40G. You might think it's a good idea to set the limit
higher just in case, but it's easy to write a program that spams output and
fills up your filesystem with junk. In such cases, it's better to have 40G of
junk than 500G.

### 3. Install Lubuntu

In "Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager" scroll down until you see "Storage". Click on
the Optical Drive, and connect it to the Lubuntu iso image you downloaded
earlier.

Press the "Start" button. Soon you will see a typical computer desktop that
looks a little like Windows.

Double-click on the "Install Lubuntu" icon on the desktop.

Click "Next" a couple times. When in doubt use the default parameters. When it
shows you the option to Erase disk, click the radio button. You cannot erase
your Windows disk. This is erasing the virtual disk you just made. Click
"Next".

Enter your name and username any way you like. Click the box to log in
automatically. Your Windows OS already has a password. You don't need another
one to get to the Linux running inside Windows. Click the "Install" buttons and
wait a few minutes while Lubuntu installs.

Click the Restart button when it asks you to. After a little while it will tell
you to remove the instllation medium and then press Enter. Just press Enter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you see the Lubuntu desktop again, click on the Devices menu at the top.
Select "Insert Guest Additions CD image...". It probably wont' autorun
properly, so we have to do this the manual way.

Click on the bird icon in the lower left of the screen. This is the Start Menu.
Under "System Tools" you will find "QTerminal". Run that. Right now, the
Lunbuntu desktop may be really small. We'll fix that later. To make sure you
can see all the terminal output, click the QTerminal's maximizing icon (looks
like 2 triangles).

Change directory to the location of your optical drive. For me, it looks
something like this.

	cd /media/ian/VBox_GAs_6.1.30

You need to run the post-install script as the super-user.

	sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

Enter your password and wait for the script to complete. Shutdown the VM by
clicking the Start Menu and choosing Leave->Shutdown.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in Oracle VM VirtualBox Manger, Select the "Settings" button.

Select the "General" tile and then click on the "Advanced" tab. Set the Shared
Clipboard to Bidirectional.

Select the "System" tile, you can change the amount of memory and the number of
processors. For software development, you can keep the 2G RAM and 1 CPU, but if
you're doing pipeline development, you may want more RAM and more CPUs. You
should always leave Windows about 4G RAM and 2 CPUs.

Select the "Storage" tile. Click on the Optical Drive and remove the
VBoxGuestAdditions.iso.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Press the Start button again. Things that now work.

+ Resize the screen by click-n-drag to whatever you like
+ Copy-paste from Windows to Linux and back

### 4. Install Anaconda

Open Firefox in your VM and head to https://www.anaconda.com to download
Anaconda. Next open your QTerminal and navigate to your Downloads folder. Run
the shell script there (the example shown below might not be the same).

	cd Downloads
	sh Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh

Read the license agreement and answer "yes" (without quotes) to accept the
terms. Use the default location for the install by pressing Enter. It will take
a little time to install. When the installer asks if you want to initialize
Anaconda3 by running conda init, answer "yes".

Close your terminal and open a new one. You should see `(base)` at the start of
each prompt. This means you're in the base `conda` environment. When you
install new bioinformatics programs or even programming languages, use `conda`
to do that for you.

For more information about `conda` see the KorfLab/learning-conda repo.

You can now remove the Anaconda install file from your Downloads folder.

### 5. Post-install Tweaks

You will use the QTerminal application all the time. To make it easy to get to,
click-n-drag its icon to the Menu Bar at the bottom of the screen (the
application is in "System Tools").

The default text editor is called FeatherPad, which can be found in the
Accessories menu. You can click-n-drag that to the Menu Bar if you like it.
However, you might want to install something else, as editors can be very
personal things.

Open the QTerminal application and create a new directory for your Code.

	mkdir Code

Make a couple directories there.

	cd Code
	mkdir bin lib

Grab the KorfLab setup repository.

	git clone https://github.com/KorfLab/setup

You will probably want to put some aliases and environment variables in your
`.bashrc`. For example, I use these conveniences.

```
alias ls="ls -F"
alias lst="ls -lrth"
alias cls="clear; ls"
alias ..="cd .."
alias gs="git status"

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Code/bin:$HOME/go/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/Code/lib
export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:$HOME/Code/lib
```

You can copy-paste these to your login script or better yet, `source` them in
from the setup repo. Put a line like this at the end of `.bashrc`, after your
conda initialization.

	source $HOME/Code/setup/profile

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This part is optional. If you want to share files between your host OS and your
VM, you need to set up a shared folder. Why would you do this?

+ You have large-ish data files you don't want to copy to the VM
+ Your favorite editor is only available on your host OS

Select the "Shared Folders" tile. Click on the folder with the + sign at the
far right to make a new shared folder.

The "Folder Path" is the folder on your host OS (Windows). Navigate to the
folder you want to share. If it doesn't exist, create it. The Folder Name
should auto-populate.

The "Mount Point" is where you want the folder to show up in your VM. For
example, if you wanted to share a data directory from your host OS, you might
use a mount point of `/home/$USER/Data`, which would show up in your Lubuntu
home, or `/data`, which would be off the filesystem root.

Check Auto-mount and Make Permanent. If the shared directory is strictly data,
you might mount it Read-only, but if it's code, then definitely not.

After clicking OK, you should be able to see the directory in your VM. However,
you don't have permission to use it. Add yourself to the vboxsf group with the
following command.

	sudo adduser $USER vboxsf

You have to restart for the changes to take effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At some point, Lubuntu will ask you if you want to apply updates. Sure, it's
always a good idea. If you don't want to wait, you can go to Start Menu ->
Preferences -> Apply Full Upgrade. This may increase the amount of space you VM
takes up. Again, a little space is a small price to pay for robustness and
reproducibility.


Directory Structure
-------------------

Your directory structure should now look something like this:

	anaconda3/
	Code/
		bin/
		lib/
		setup/
	Desktop/
	Documents/
	Downloads/
	Music/
	Pictures/
	Public/
	Templates/
	Videos/

Do all of your software development and testing in the Code directory. Each
sub-directory should be a git repo.


Programs vs. Pipelines vs. Notebooks
------------------------------------

There are 3 overlapping computer activities we tend to do.

1. Software development in Python, C, Go, etc
2. Running pipelines in Snakemake
3. Exploring data in R-Studio or Jupyter notebooks

### Software Development

You should already know Python before moving on to other languages. Our overall
philosophy is that code should be simple and beautiful. Please see the
algorithms repo https://github.com/KorfLab/algorithms.

To get started with Go, see the https://github.com/KorfLab/learning-go

To get started with C, see the https://github.com/KorfLab/learning-C

### Running Pipelines

When analyzing large datasets, there are generally 3 tasks: installing
software, developing a pipeline, deploying a pipeline. Always install software
with Conda. Don't rely on the local environment. Pipelines are developed in
Snakemake on a test set in you VM, not the cluster. Once you are ready to
deploy a pipeline, then you can run on the cluster.

Pipelines are developed using Conda and Snakemake. Develop your Snakemake
pipelines on a small test set in a VM, and not on the cluster. These practices
ensure maximum portability and reproducible data practices.

1. Conda - https://github.com/KorfLab/learning-conda
2. Snakemake - https://github.com/KorfLab/learning-snakemake
3. Cluster - https://github.com/KorfLab/spitfire

### Notebook Computing

We're not talking about laptops but rather R-Studio or Jupyter. These tools are
great for exploring data, but are not a great way of distributing software. Use
them where they are useful.


Managing Data
-------------

We have a repo for -omic data processing called datacore. If you are developing
a new dataset that will be useful to others, put the scripts and a small
selection of data in datacore. Don't fill up datacore or any repo with large
datafiles.

https://github.com/KorfLab/datacore

Data is generally kept in a completely separate place from code. If you have
scripts in the same directory with data, you're doing it wrong. Code belongs in
your github repos. On the cluster, we put data in `/share/korflab/projects`.
See the spitfire repo for more information.

In the same way that you have a `README.md` in every repo, you should also put
a `README.md` in every project directory that describes the intent and
contents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose I've written a new genome analysis program called `smash` that looks
something like this:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import argparse
import grimoire
# the rest of the code...
```

Suppose I want to run `smash` on some genomes. I'm no longer doing code
development, but analysis. Therefore, my actions don't really belong in the
`Code` directory. So I make a new directory for the project off the home
directory.

```
(base) ian@virtualbox: mkdir ~/Smashing
(base) ian@virtualbox: cd ~/Smashing
(base) ian@virtualbox: smash ~/Data/genomes/hg19.fa > smash.out
```

In order to get all of this to work, `smash` must be in my executable path.
Since `smash` depends on `grimoire`, it follows that `grimoire` must be in my
library path. If you followed the KorfLab/setup, you already have `Code/bin` in
your `PATH` and `Code/lib` in your `PYTHONPATH`. You can alias files to those
directories to make them visible to the shell and Python.

Your directory layout should look like this:

```
anaconda3/
Code/
	bin/
		smash@ -> ../smashrepo/smash
	lib/
		grimoire@ -> ../grimoire/grimoire
	setup/
	smashrepo/
		smash*
Data/
	genomes/
		hg19.fa
Desktop/
Documents/
Downloads/
Smashing/
	smash.out
```

Managing data is different from code. Data can be large and expensive to
generate. It should backed up or mirrored somewhere, and it should have
read-only permissions to prevent it from being changed.

If you're doing development and working with VMs, don't copy data to each VM.
Create a read-only shared folder. In the listing above, it may look like `Data`
is in the directory, but it is not. It's just the mount point for a shared
folder.
