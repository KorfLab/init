## 1 Percent Genomes ##

A few of the earliest Eukaryotic genomes sequenced are provided shrunken down
to 1 percent. Each has a FASTA file of the genome and a GFF3 describing the
genes (and spliced RNA-seq observations).

- A. thaliana
	- `at1pct.fa.gz`
	- `at1pct.gff3.gz`
- C. elegans
	- `ce1pct.fa.gz`
	- `ce1pct.gff3.gz`
- D. melanogaster
	- `dm1pct.fa.gz`
	- `dm1pct.gff3.gz`

## E. coli K-12 ##

E. coli was the first genome sequenced in its entirety. The K-12 variant is
provided in several files.

- `GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.fna.gz` FASTA format
- `GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.gbff.gz` GenBank format with annotations
- `GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.gff.gz` GenBank-flavored GFF
- `GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_protein.faa.gz` Proteins in FASTA format
