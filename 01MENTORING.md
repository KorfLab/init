> Helping you become the person you want to be

You have joined my research group because we have a shared interest in using
computers to solve problems in molecular biology. Not a lot of people in the
world share this passion, and it is the first of several important bonds we
will share.

There are a lot of ways to be curious and useful in bioinformatics. Where do
you fit in? Our job is to figure that out. I say _our_ because we are in this
together. As the mentor, my role is to be your guide, advisor, critic, and
supporter. As the mentee, your role is to be curious, open-minded, studious,
and committed. We won't always play our roles perfectly. That's okay. Like
science, we will always be a work in progress.

Mentorship is not free. You "pay" with your attention, effort, communication,
collaboration, and interest.

I prefer to be honest and open as much as possible. So let's start off with the
harsh realitites: science is filled with difficulties. Projects will fail.
Great ideas will be abandoned. You will get scooped. Your paper/application
will be rejected for no discernable reason. You will meet geniuses who
intimidate the fuck out of you. Under these cicrumstances, it is normal for
mentees to feel overwhelmed and to question their belonging. While _normal_,
these feelings are also _undeserved_. Scientists are particularly bad at
self-evaluation and tend to trivialize their worth and contributions.

The particular flavor of science in my lab can make you feel especially
unprepared. You are entering a research setting at the intersection of
genetics, molecular biology, statistics, computer science, software
engineering, and information technology. To be effective, you will not only
have to know quite a bit about each of these fields, but how to put them
together in meaningful and novel ways. As a result, it can take a while for you
to experience the successes that will give you a feeling of mastery.

So how are you going to navigate the complexities and difficulties that lie
ahead? How are you going to end up feeling a sense of accomplishment and
belonging in the harsh world of academic science? It starts with communication.
We have to talk. Often. And not just about the details of your next experiment.
We need to talk about your goals, both career-based and personal. You have
chosen a difficult path, and you will need support along the way. Support can
take many forms from your _research friends_, to your best friend from 6th
grade, to a professional therapist. No great athletes get where they are alone.
They all have huge support structures beneath them. Scientists are like the pro
athletes of the intellecutal world. To be successful, we need support too.

As your mentor, I will be an important part of your support team. And believe
it or not, you will also be part of mine. We're in this together.

## What do you want to be? ##

As a mentee in my lab, you have an interest in science. You might imagine
several career paths ahead. Each role has different expectations.

- PI: Principle Investigator, Group Leader, Independent Investigator
	- You have lots of ideas
	- You like designing experiments
	- You are self-motivated
	- You are obsessive about probably everything
	- You take pride in your imagination
	- You are energized by novelty
	- You are drained by routine
- Scientist: Lab Tech, Staff Scientist, Researcher, Expert
	- You like solving problems
	- You like conducting experiments
	- You respond quickly to requests
	- You like troubleshooting
	- You take pride in a job well done
	- You are energized by success
	- You are drained by indecision
- Educator: Teaching Professor, Science Communicator
	- You enjoy interacting with students
	- You like documentaries
	- Your class notes are like artwork
	- You like writing
	- You take pride when the lights go in students' faces
	- You are energized by collaboration
	- You are drained by isolation

As a mentee, you may not know which role fits you best. You might think of
yourself in one role, but you're actually best in another role.

Nature shows us that two reproductive strategies work: you can be k-selected or
r-selected. In other words, you can have lots of babies and not really take
care of them, or you can have few babies and take very good care of them. The
other situations don't work.

```
                 high care | low care
                -----------|-----------
many offspring | mom dies  | works     |
               |-----------|-----------|
few offspring  | works     | babes die |
                -----------|-----------
```

Let's try a 2x2 matrix of inventiveness vs. getting things done (gtd).

```
                 high gtd | low gtd
                ----------|---------
high inventive | madness  | scout   |
               |----------|---------|
low inventive  | worker   | idle    |
                ----------|---------
```

A scout is a high risk, high reward occupation. We need scouts to explore the
unknown. Many will not succeeed, but the few who do are worth the expense.
Scouts are not good at menial labor or routine tasks. They need novelty and
ownership.

A worker is a low risk, low reward occupation. Someone has to stay at home and
do the daily chores be they farming, cooking, raising the next generation, or
defending against enemies. A worker takes comfort in routine and a job well
done.

The person who has lots of ideas and works to get them all done is insane. One
cannot simultaneously be a scout and a worker, and the attempt will end in
madness. Hence, the "mad scientist".

A person who doesn't have ideas and doesn't get many things done is currently
idle. There are many flavors of idle.

- Novice: insufficient skill to be useful, requires training
- Recovering: too busy healing to be of any use right now
- Hedonist: too busy enjoying life to be useful
- Overwhelmed: too stressed by life to be useful
- Laggard: too slow to be useful
