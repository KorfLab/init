## Programming and Self-Motivation Required ##

Most scientists are do-gooders who want to be useful. In a molecular biology
lab, you can be useful immediately: there are dishes to wash, solutions to
prepare, and instrumments you can learn to use with a week of training. There
are no such tasks here. In order to be useful in this lab, you need to be at
least an intermediate level programmer. Here are some things you need to be
able to do:

- Work in a Unix/Linux CLI to run programs and manage files
- Read and write text files
- Use a command line interface (e.g. argparse in Python)
- Build and navigate arbitrarily nested data structures

To gain these skills, you can take my course MCB185 either officially or on
your own (https://github.com/iankorf/MCB185). To test yourself try taking the
KorfLab Bioinformatics Exam in `07_EXAM.md`.

In addition to programming, you need to be self-motivated. I'm not the kind of
PI who checks in on you constantly. I make myself available to students for
several hours per week. If we haven't had a recent meeting, it's 100% your
fault. I will help you every step of the way on just about anything you want
help on, but you have to ask.

MCB185 is a base level of skills and the exam is a base level assessment. Many
projects require a more advanced level of programming. If you want more
training problems, try solving some classic bioinformatics programming problems
in `0_6CLASSICS.md`. Also, the files in `init/bin` and `init/lib` can serve as
examples of typical KorfLab coding style.


Work-Life Balance in Academic Science
=====================================

Thoughts on the problems of being a scientist in academia.

## Fast, Cheap, Reliable ##

There is a saying when it comes to race cars: "fast, cheap, reliable: pick
two". There is a recognition that you can't have everything.

In Science, we don't say that. The sentiment is more like "intelligent,
creative, self-motivated, hard-working, independent, collaborative,
disciplined, flexible, reliable, accountable, personable: choose (all) eleven".

- Intelligent - you can solve the problems that are in front of you
- Creative - you can find new problems to solve
- Self-motivated - nobody has to tell you to show up for work
- Hard-working - you work many hours
- Independent - you don't need others to succeed
- Collaborative - you recognize success requires others, and welcome them
- Disciplined - you can behave precisely as required
- Flexible - you make room for difficulties
- Reliable - people can count on you to show up or deliver on time
- Accountable - you take credit for your failures
- Personable - you are likable as a person and co-worker

It's unfair to be expected to be good at everything, and yet many scientists
beat themselves up because they aren't. Give yourself the breathing room you
would give to others. You don't have to be an A+ or even A- in all of these.
Sometimes ok is good enough. But try not to have an F in any of them.

## Work Ethic ##

How hard does one _need_ to work? Partly, that depends on your future plans.

Back when I was in graduate school, everyone had the same goal: become a
professor. That's a little unrealistic. There aren't that many jobs for
professors. The probability of becoming a professor at a Tier 1 research
university is less than playing in the NBA. All the professors you know right
now worked really hard as graduate students, and even harder as post-docs
because they had to. It wasn't possible to become a professor unless you were
working some evenings and weekends because that's what everyone else on your
path was doing. Is that still true today? Probably. Is it unhealthy for future
professors to work 50-60 hours per week? Probably. Is this a form of academic
hazing? Probably. Ultimately, if you have designs on becoming a professor, you
might need to work 50-60 hours per week because your competition is doing just
that. On the plus side, being a professor is a pretty great job most of the
time and I have a hard time imagining myself doing something else.

What if you want to be a staff scientist job in an industry setting? If the
company is well-established, you might end up in a 40 hour work week with HR
telling you not allowed to work more. However, in a start-up you might be
working harder than you would trying to become a professor.


Researcher Effectiveness Rating
===============================

Your RER is a measure of how well you are playing the Bioinformatics Researcher
Game in the Korf Lab. This is a kind of self-assessment. If you want a high
RER, you should do the following:

- Be more proactive than reactive or non-active
- Be interactive and collaborative with other members of the lab
- Follow best practices in your computer environment
