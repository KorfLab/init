Mentoring

> Helping you become the person you want to be

You have joined my research group because we have a shared interest in using
computers to solve problems in molecular biology. Not a lot of people in the
world share this passion, and it is the first of several important bonds we
will share.

There are a lot of ways to be curious and useful in bioinformatics. Where do
you fit in? Our job is to figure that out. I say _our_ because we are in this
together. As the mentor, my role is to be your guide, advisor, critic, and
supporter. As the mentee, your role is to be curious, open-minded, studious,
and committed. We won't always play our roles perfectly. That's okay. Like
science, we will always be a work in progress.

Mentorship is not free. You "pay" with your attention, effort, communication,
collaboration, and interest.

I prefer to be honest and open as much as possible. So let's start off with the
harsh realitites: science is filled with difficulties. Projects will fail.
Great ideas will be abandoned. You will get scooped. Your paper/application
will be rejected for no discernable reason. You will meet geniuses who
intimidate the fuck out of you. Under these cicrumstances, it is normal for
mentees to feel overwhelmed and to question their belonging. While _normal_,
these feelings are also _undeserved_. Scientists are particularly bad at
self-evaluation and tend to trivialize their worth and contributions.

The particular flavor of science in my lab can make you feel especially
unprepared. You are entering a research setting at the intersection of
genetics, molecular biology, statistics, computer science, software
engineering, and information technology. To be effective, you will not only
have to know quite a bit about each of these fields, but how to put them
together in meaningful and novel ways. As a result, it can take a while for you
to experience the successes that will give you a feeling of mastery.

So how are you going to navigate the complexities and difficulties that lie
ahead? How are you going to end up feeling a sense of accomplishment and
belonging in the harsh world of academic science? It starts with communication.
We have to talk. Often. And not just about the details of your next experiment.
We need to talk about your goals, both career-based and personal. You have
chosen a difficult path, and you will need support along the way. Support can
take many forms from your _research friends_, to your best friend from 6th
grade, to a professional therapist. No great athletes get where they are alone.
They all have huge support structures beneath them. Scientists are like the pro
athletes of the intellecutal world. To be successful, we need support too.

As your mentor, I will be an important part of your support team. And believe
it or not, you will also be part of mine. We're in this together.

## What do you want to be? ##

Nature shows us that two reproductive strategies work: you can have lots of
babies and not really take care of them, or you can have few babies and take
very good care of them. The other situations don't work.

```
                 high care | low care
                -----------|-----------
many offspring | mom dies  | works     |
               |-----------|-----------|
few offspring  | works     | babes die |
                -----------|-----------
```

In society, successful people are generally either scouts or workers. Other
strategies are less successful.

```
                 high gtd | low gtd
                ----------|---------
high inventive | madness  | scout   |
               |----------|---------|
low inventive  | worker   | waiting |
                ----------|---------
```

A scout is a high risk, high reward occupation. We need scouts to explore the
unknown. Many will not succeeed, but the few who do are worth the expense.
Scouts are often not good at menial labor or routine tasks. They need novelty
and ownership. That said, scouts have to survive training, which involves
unexciting tasks.

A worker is a lower risk, lower reward occupation. Someone has to stay at home
and do the daily chores be they farming, cooking, raising the next generation,
or defending against enemies. A worker takes pride in a job well done. Workers
also solve problems in inventive ways.

The person who has lots of ideas and works to get them all done is insane. One
cannot simultaneously be a scout and a worker, and the attempt will end in
madness.

A person who doesn't have ideas and doesn't get anything done is waiting. There
are several flavors of waiting.

- Novice: insufficient skill to be useful, requires training
- Recuperating: healing from injuries, requires time
- Overwhelmed: too stressed by life to be useful, requires patience
- Infirm: unable to work, requires assistance
- Hedonist: too busy enjoying life to be useful, requires motivating

Most trainees are novices. They need training before they can be useful. There
is nothing wrong with being a trainee. But as a trainee, you aren't going to
contribute meaningfully to the work we do. Your job is to gain skills first.

One day, you may have a science career as a Principle Investigator, Lab Tech,
or Educator. What kinds of properties do these positions typically have?

- PI: Principle Investigator, Group Leader, Independent Investigator
	- You take pride in: your ideas
	- You are energized by: novelty, puzzles
	- You are drained by: administrative tasks
	- People are amazed by your: creativity, intelligence
	- Some people call you: crazy
	- You go to work because: it's play
	- You will get out of this mess by: invention
- Lab Tech: Staff Scientist, Researcher, Expert
	- You take pride in: a job well done
	- You are energized by: fixing things, success
	- You are drained by: indecision, failure
	- People are amazed by your: skills, attention to detail
	- Some people call you: obsessive
	- You go to work because: it's your job
	- You will get out of this mess by: working harder
- Educator: Teaching Professor, Science Communicator
	- You take pride in: helping others
	- You are energized by: collaboration, success of others
	- You are drained by: isolation
	- People are amazed by your: thoughfulness, organization, writing
	- Some people call you: weird
	- You go to work because: people need you
	- You will get out of this mess by: helping others

As a mentee, you may not know which role fits you best. You might think of
yourself in one role, but you're actually best in another role. It's sometimes
useful to break the mold and do something different from expected. A PI with
Lab Tech or Educator tendencies might make an unusually great PI. However, a
Lab Tech with PI tendencies probablly doesn't work. It could take a lifetime
figuring out where you belong. I hope your time in my lab helps you find
yourself.
